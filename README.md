## 1. üß† Understanding the Problem

### Key Problems for Students:

* Overreliance on CGPA or college tier rather than actual skills.
* Lack of platforms to showcase verified project work or skills.
* Confusing application processes with little feedback or guidance.

### Key Problems for Recruiters:

* Difficulty verifying student skill levels without formal experience.
* Time wasted shortlisting candidates with poor alignment to role requirements.
* Need for a pipeline of pre-assessed, skill-ready candidates.

### Pain Points in Current Funnels:

* Students get lost in generic listings with little customization.
* Recruiters receive a flood of resumes without real indicators of ability.
* Platforms focus on quantity over match quality.

### Assumptions:

* Students are willing to build portfolios to improve visibility.
* Recruiters will value demonstrated skill over pedigree.
* Both parties prefer a simple, curated platform.

## 3. üöÄ Market and Platform Differentiation

### Existing Platforms:

* LinkedIn
* Internshala
* Handshake
* Turing

### Their Approaches:

* LinkedIn: Broad networking; weak in project-based skill validation.
* Internshala: Listing-heavy with little portfolio depth.
* Handshake: Strong university tie-ins but limited global exposure.
* Turing: Tests-based matching, mostly for experienced developers.

### Our Differentiators:

* Skill-first, not resume-first.
* Public and peer-verified portfolios.
* Recruiters see actual code, designs, and project links.
* Minimalist, focused UI for fast interaction.
